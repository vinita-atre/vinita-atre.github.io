					<h3>Problem and Hypothesis</h3>

					<p>Our application had low trial to paid conversion rate.</p>
					<p> Based on product usage analytics and interviews with our customer support teams, we hypothesized that trial(new) customers  
						<ul><li>Experienced difficulty recognizing product value,</li>
							<li>Lacked triggers for engagement with the key activities like testing candidates, adding jobs, and application login,</li>
							<li>Wanted to understand the candidate assessment experience and reports,</li>

				<p>1. <br><b>Quickstart timeline concept increased user engagement and product feature discovery.</b></p>
				<p>Why ? <br>Our quickstart timeline concept was liked due to its hands-on approach by users.
					The quickstart timeline contained key value delivery activities to get users to the Aha moment.<br>How ?<br>
				We designed using design principles like Miller's law, need for completion (Nir eyal in Hooked) etc to promote more users to have positive actions on the platform quickly. We tested the particular steps desirable for trial(new) user, the flow and layout as well as the copy with customers and internal stakeholders.</p>

			<h3>What I learned</h3><br>
			<ol><li>
				<p>
					<span style="color:#F65959">Test with real users</span></p>
					<p>
					Because of this project, we realized the importance of external user testing as it provided us with contrasting feedback on our interactive guided paths design concepts when compared to the internal stakeholder testing. The interactive guided paths were found be informative and useful by internal stakeholders but undesirable by external stakeholders.  </p>
				</li>
				<li>

					<p><span style="color:#F65959">Use proven UX methods but also improvise as needed</span></p>
					<p>

						I proposed using the talk aloud method for testing prototypes with external users which proved highly valuable to get more specific and genuine feedback. The interviewer was able to follow up with appropriate questions due to the increased interview engagement to uncover deeper insights about the design concepts.
