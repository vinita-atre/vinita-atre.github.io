				<h3>Problem and Hypothesis</h3>

				<p>Our application had low trial to paid conversion rate.</p>
				<p> Based on product usage analytics and interviews with our customer support teams, we hypothesized that trial(new) customers  
					<ul><li>Experienced difficulty recognizing product value,</li>
						<li>Lacked triggers for engagement with the key activities like testing candidates, adding jobs, and application login,</li>
						<li>Wanted to understand the candidate assessment experience and reports,</li>

						Overall, we conducted 2 rounds of external user testing with 5 and 7 users respectively as well as 2 rounds of internal stakeholder testing with 13 and 17 stakeholders respectively. <!--We conducted remote semi-structured interviews with customers using video conferencing and screenshare. With internal stakeholders, we conducted silent note-taking group feedback which was a highly successful method for soliciting honest feedbcak efficiently.--> </p>

				<p>Our quickstart timeline concept was liked as a hands-on approach to get users started in using the product to get to their aha moment which increased user engagement and product feature discovery. The quickstart timeline conatined key value delivery activities to get users to the Aha moment. We designed and tested the steps in the timeline, the layouts as well as the copy. The timeline aimed to increase engagement  for trial(new) users early on to recognize product value easily and quickly."user-quote"</p>

			</a>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>
		During brainstorming, we went through several different design concepts that ultimately did not satisfy the trial customer’s needs. 
	</p>
	<div class= "row">
		<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-4 col-sm-12 ">

			Our initial designs for the test preview experience were shown to be overloaded with too much information which overwhelmed the users and led them to abandon the preview without gaining any better understanding of the tests. 
			Using the positive feedback, we gained an understanding of the most critical pieces of information which helped us to design a shorter and simpler test preview experience. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Our landing page design concept explaining the product laying out options for self-learning guided paths discouraged and confused the user as they wanted to cut to the chase and just start using the platform. A user said “ Setting up account is enough work! I dont want to do more than required.”</p>
		<p>
			User testing the guided path design concept for interpreting results showed that users did not prefer to explore the application in a long and linear flow.
			Overall although we had found the existing wizard experiences to be less popular in previous research, we attempted to design better wizards as enhanced guided paths to be more contextual, informative with answers to some of the most commonly asked questions. However the user testing further proved that users really did not care for learning and help before using the application but would much rather use help resources like FAQ and articles for specific problems that may arise. 
			A user said “I prefer self-guided information but dismissable where I have the option of clicking and learning or exiting”
			We leveraged the positive feedback about the specific information that was helpful in the guided paths and added them as lightweight one-time tooltips in the experience.

		<h3>Positive Results and much more to do ...</h3>
		<h5>Direct Impact on Conversion</h5>
		<div class="row">
			<div class ="col-lg-6">
				<p>
				The redesign of the customer onboarding experience has had a positive impact on the engagement with product, value discovery and conversion rate, at the time of writing (2 months since launch). However, we did not see a reduced time for conversion. I believe this to be a behavior change that will reveal over a longer period of time.</p>						

				<p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Number of trial customers who created job openings increased by 9.2%</p></li>
						<li><p>Number of trial customers who tested at least one candidate using WonScore increased by 7.7%</p></li>
						<li><p>Upto 85% increase in conversion in the following months of trial customers to paid customers( multiple additional factors involved)</p></li>
						<li><p>Because we have help resources available upfront on the home page, we have seen a reduced number of calls to the customer support team.</p></li></ul>
						For confidentiality reasons I have omitted the actual values for these metrics

							<h3>What I  learned</h3>
							<p>
								<span style="color:#F65959">Test with real users.</span></p><p>
								Because of this project, we realized the importance of external user testing as it provided us with contrasting feedback on our interactive guided paths design concepts when compared to the internal stakeholder testing. The interactive guided paths were found be informative and useful by internal stakeholders but undesirable by external stakeholders.  </p>

								<p><span style="color:#F65959">Use proven UX methods but also improvise as needed</span></p>
								<p>

									I proposed using the talk aloud method for testing prototypes with external users which proved highly valuable to get more specific and genuine feedback. The interviewer was able to follow up with appropriate questions due to the increased interview engagement to uncover deeper insights about the design concepts. 

								</p>
								<p><span style="color:#F65959">Design and Communicate research insights to all stakeholders</span></p>
								<p>

									I lead the team to create a hierarchical affinity diagram to view themes in our research data which helped design interactions and concepts, informed product strategy to the product and business stakeholders as well as helped build empathy and understanding of the user for the engineering team.
