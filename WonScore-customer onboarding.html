					<h3>Problem and Hypothesis</h3>

					<p>Our application had a lower than expected trial to paid conversion rates. Based on reviewing product usage analytics and interviews with customer support teams, we hypothesized that trial(new) customers were unable to recognize the value of the application, had low engagement with the key activities of the application like exploring onboarding wizard, testing candidates, adding jobs, and application login as well as needed higher degree of in-application support to correctly start using the application.</p>
					<p >
					Additionally, we also found that many trial customers would administer a dummy test to themselves to experience the tests themselves and evaluate their test reports which are highly unrecommended by our IO experts.</p>
					<h3>My Role</h3>
					<p class >

						I was the solo UX designer on a cross-functional team comprised of a developer, a user researcher, a product owner, and a business analyst. 

						I was responsible for determining the overall design direction while partnering with the rest of the team on ideation.

						I was also responsible for evaluating the designs with stakeholders by partnering with the user researcher.

						I was also responsible for designing the mockups for dev handoff as per the technical and product constraints.

						<p >Customers surveys showed that both trial and paid customers found the application easy to use however, trail customers were unclear about the value proposition of the application. Both cohorts preferred a hands-on approach of trying out a new application themselves to learn about it.
							Using market research and competitor analysis, we created a list of best practices and experiences for onboarding which provided broader understanding as well as design inspiration.

								<h3>Challenges faced, including design concepts that were ultimately not pursued</h3>
								<p>
									During brainstorming, we went through several different design concepts that ultimately did not satisfy the trial customer’s needs.

									Our initial designs for the test preview experience were shown to be overloaded with too detailed with too much information which overwhelmed the users and led them to abandon the preview without gaining any better understanding of the tests. 
									Using the positive feedback, we gained an understanding of the most critical pieces of information which helped us to design a shorter and simpler test preview experience. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Our landing page design concept explaining the product laying out options for self-learning guided paths discouraged and confused the user as they wanted to cut to the chase and just start using the platform. A user said “ Setting up account is enough work! I dont want to do more than required.”
									<p>
										Our guided path design concept for interpreting results showed that users did not prefer to explore the application in a long and linear flow.
										Overall although we had found the existing wizard experiences to be less popular in previous research, we attempted to design better wizards as enhanced guided paths to be more contextual, informative with answers to some of the most commonly asked questions. The user testing further proved that users really did not care for learning and help before using the application but would much rather use help resources like FAQ and articles for specific problems that may arise. We leveraged the positive feedback about the specific information that was helpful in the guided paths and added them as lightweight one-time tooltips in the experience. A user said “I prefer self-guided information but dismissable where I have the option of clicking and learning or exiting”

									</p>
									<h3>Positive Results and much more to do ...</h3>
									<p>
										The redesign of the customer onboarding experience has had a positive impact on the engagement with product, value discovery and conversion rate,  at the time of writing (2 months since launch). However, we did not see a reduced time for conversion. I believe this to be a behavior change that will reveal over a longer period of time.
										<ul>
											<li>Number of trial customers who created job openings increased by 9.2%</li>
											<li>Number of trial customers who tested at least one candidate using WonScore increased by 7.7%</li>
											<li>Upto 85% increase in conversion in the following months of trial customers to paid customers( multiple additional factors involved)</li>
											<li>Because we have help resources available upfront on the home page, we have seen a reduced number of calls to the customer support team. </li></ul>
											For confidentiality reasons I have omitted the actual values for these metrics
										</p>
										<p>
											Created a  credible way for non-candidates to preview the test experience helps the business to maintain its scientific integrity.
										</p>
										<p>
											As the application lacked a home page, creating one with a clean and modern look & feel now makes the product feel more SaaS and at par with many user and industry standards. 

										</p>
										<h3>
										What I  learned</h3><p>
											Because of this project, we realized the importance of external user testing as it provided us with contrasting feedback on our interactive guided paths design concepts when compared to the internal stakeholder testing. The interactive guided paths were found be informative and useful by internal stakeholders but undesirable by external stakeholders. <span style="color:#F65959">So always test with real users.</span> </p>
											<p>

												I proposed using the talk aloud method for testing prototypes with external users which proved highly valuable to get more specific and genuine feedback. The interviewer was able to follow up with appropriate questions due to the increased interview engagement to uncover deeper insights about the design concepts. 
												<span style="color:#F65959">Innovate your design process using established standard processes and experimentation"</span>
											</p>
											<p>

												I lead the team to create a hierarchical affinity diagram to view themes in our research data which helped design interactions and concepts, informed product strategy to the product and business stakeholders as well as helped build empathy and understanding of the user for the engineering team. 

											</p>
